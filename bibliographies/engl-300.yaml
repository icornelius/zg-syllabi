  abstract: >-
    How and why do languages change? This new introduction offers a guide to the
    types of change at all levels of linguistic structure, as well as the
    mechanisms behind each type. Based on data from a variety of methods and a
    huge array of language families, it examines general patterns of change,
    bringing together recent findings on sound change, analogical change,
    grammaticalization, the creation and change of constructions, as well as
    lexical change. Emphasizing crosslinguistic patterns and going well beyond
    traditional methods in historical linguistics, this book sees change as
    grounded in cognitive processes and usage factors that are rarely mentioned
    in other textbooks. Complete with questions for discussion, suggested
    readings and a useful glossary of terms, this book helps students to gain a
    general understanding of language as an ever-changing system.

    This Language, A River is an introduction to the history of English that
    recognizes multiple varieties of the language in both current and historical
    contexts. Developed over years of undergraduate teaching, the book helps
    students both to grasp traditional histories of English and to extend and
    complicate those histories.  Exercises throughout provide opportunities for
    puzzling out concepts, committing terms and data to memory, and applying
    ideas. A comprehensive glossary and up-to-date bibliographies help to guide
    further study.
