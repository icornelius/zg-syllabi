  abstract: >-
    Throughout human history, the world's knowledge and fruits of the creative
    imagination have been produced, circulated and received through the medium
    of the material text. This Companion provides a wide-ranging account of the
    history of the book and its ways of thinking about works from ancient
    inscription to contemporary e-books, discussing thematic, chronological and
    methodological aspects of this interdisciplinary field. The first part
    considers book cultures from local, national and global perspectives. Part
    two, organized around the dynamic relationship between the material book and
    the mutable text, develops a loosely chronological narrative from early
    writing, through manuscript and early printing, to the institution of a
    mechanized book trade, and on to the globalization of publishing and the
    introduction of the electronic book. A third part takes a practical turn,
    discussing methods, sources and approaches: bibliographical, archival and
    reading experience methodologies, as well as pedagogical strategies.

  abstract: "A comprehensive resource to understanding the hand-press printing of early books Studying Early Printed Books, 1450 - 1800 offers a guide to the fascinating process of how books were printed in the first centuries of the press and shows how the mechanics of making books shapes how we read and understand them. The author offers an insightful overview of how books were made in the hand-press period and then includes an in-depth review of the specific aspects of the printing process. She addresses questions such as: How was paper made? What were different book formats? How did the press work? In addition, the text is filled with illustrative examples that demonstrate how understanding the early processes can be helpful to today’s researchers. Studying Early Printed Books shows the connections between the material form of a book (what it looks like and how it was made), how a book conveys its meaning and how it is used by readers. The author helps readers navigate books by explaining how to tell which parts of a book are the result of early printing practices and which are a result of later changes. The text also offers guidance on: how to approach a book; how to read a catalog record; the difference between using digital facsimiles and books in-hand. This important guide:  Reveals how books were made with the advent of the printing press and how they are understood today Offers information on how to use digital reproductions of early printed books as well as how to work in a rare books library Contains a useful glossary and a detailed list of recommended readings Includes a companion website for further research\_  Written for students of book history, materiality of text and history of information, Studying Early Printed Books explores the many aspects of the early printing process of books and explains how their form is understood today."
