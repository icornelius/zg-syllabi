  abstract: >-
    The fourteenth-century poem Sir Gawain and the Green Knight is one of the
    greatest classics of English literature, but one of the least accessible to
    most twentieth-century readers. Written in an obscure dialect, it is far
    more difficult to digest in the original than are most other late medieval
    English works. Yet any translation is bound to lose much of the flavour of
    the original.   This edition of the poem offers the original text together
    with a facing-page translation. With the alliterative Middle English before
    the reader, James Winny provides a non-alliterative and sensitively literal
    rendering in modern English. This edition also provides an introduction,
    explanatory and textual notes, a further note on some words that present
    particular difficulties, and, in the appendices, two contemporary stories,
    The Feast of Bricriu and The Knight of the Sword, which provide insight on
    the poem.
