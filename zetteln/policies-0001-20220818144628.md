No two editions are exactly the same.
The [textbooks](#texts) adopted for this course are selected on criteria of cost, quality, and availability.
These editions form the basis for class discussions; their glosses and commentary are necessary adjuncts to the primary text.

Students must acquire physical copies of textbooks.
For *Hamlet* you must have two texts, the first quarto and second quarto.
The 2006 edition of the Arden Shakespeare *Hamlet* (second quarto text) is an acceptable alternative to the 2016 edition.
If you own a modern editorial conflation of the second quarto and the first folio of *Hamlet* and do not wish to purchase another edition of this play, borrow an appropriate edition from the library or through Interlibrary Loan.
Plan ahead.

In recognition that some students may already own editions of Chaucer's poetry, I have compiled a [bibliography of acceptable alternatives](https://www.zotero.org/irc7/collections/FI5JX2P6).
Consult me before using an edition not on this list.
In several cases the acceptable alternatives are more expensive than the edition at the campus bookstore.
