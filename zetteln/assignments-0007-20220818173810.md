Once during the semester, you will interview one of your peers about the content of their most recent response paper.
The interviews will be conducted during our class session and should be between five and ten minutes in length.
As interviewer, you are responsible for being interested in your interviewee, drawing them out about their writing, exploring lateral connections, and prompting them to elaborate the ideas that they have presented.
There will be opportunity for audience participation at the end of each interview.
