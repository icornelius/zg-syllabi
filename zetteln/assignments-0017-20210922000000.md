Respond to one of the following prompts.
For general instructions see the syllabus.

1. Compare Sarah Werner's account of early modern printed books with G.S. Ivy's "Bibliography of the Manuscript-Book."
Identify and briefly discuss two features of book production that remained constant across this technological change.

1. Read William Thynne's dedicatory preface to his 1532 edition of Chaucer's *Works* and elaborate or respond to Megan Cook's analysis of this text (pp. 26--29 in "The First First Folios").
Thynne's preface may be read in Loyola's copy of the 1687 *Works* or on [Early English Books Online](https://www.proquest.com/eebo/docview/2248593320/C8ACCE0A95B14C17PQ/4).

1. Schedule a research visit to University Archives and Special Collections and request to view one of the early printed books we viewed during our class visit.
Leaf through the book, then select one page and describe it in as much detail as you can.
To what extent does this page conform to general features of early printed books, as described by Werner?
Include an image of the page at the end of your response paper.

1. Select Caxton's prologue to either the *Canterbury Tales* or the *Eneydos*.
Discuss briefly the relation of this text to central themes of our seminar, as described in [section 2](https://icornelius.github.io/zg-syllabi/files/engl390-2022-fall.pdf#section.2) of the syllabus.
