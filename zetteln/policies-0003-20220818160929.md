If illness or another event in your life prevents you from completing a written assignment on time, alert me promptly by email.
Do not wait for me to contact you.
I will usually accommodate late work, provided that you have a legitimate reason for requesting an extension.
Unexcused late work will be marked down and cannot be revised for a higher grade.

In the week in which you circulate your [response paper](#response-papers) to class, this paper is due 24 hours in advance of our class meeting.
This is the most important deadline in our course, for our class session depends on the content you supply.
Missing this deadline will result in a penalty of up to 40 participation points.

The other deadline that commands rigorous respect is the one for the final essay.
The University requires me to report grades within 72 hours of our scheduled final exam.
If your final essay is late, I might not be able to give you credit for it.
