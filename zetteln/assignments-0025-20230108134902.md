There are regular quizzes, usually one per week.
Quizzes are worth 5 points each; the top 10 results count towards your final grade (50 points total).
It is usually not possible to make up a missed quiz.

Quizzes assess your knowledge and understanding of course content and skills in literary reading and interpretation.
There are several formats, including the following:

- Passage identification (see under [Exams](#exams)).
- Short answer, multiple choice, or matching.
  These formats test your reading comprehension and understanding of lectures and class activities.
  Literary terms introduced by peers in the [presentation](#class-presentation) are eligible to appear on quizzes.
