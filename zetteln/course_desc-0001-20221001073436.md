What power does a voice have?
In this course we study defiant, bold, despondent, and expressive voices that speak out from the pages of literary verse, prose, and drama.
Readings include
Gloria Anzald√∫a's "How to Tame a Wild Tongue,"
Sophocles's *Antigone*,
Shakespeare's *The Tempest*,
Plato's *Apology of Socrates*,
Margery Kempe's *Book*,
The Wife of Bath's Prologue and Tale (from Geoffrey Chaucer's *Canterbury Tales*),
and short poems by
Anna Letitia Barbauld,
Judith Ortiz Cofer,
Paul Laurence Dunbar,
Edna St. Vincent Millay,
Alexander Pope,
Dudley Randall,
and
Percy Bysshe Shelley.
Through these readings we gain experience of forms of English different from the modern standard and we develop heightened and sharpened powers of attention to literary creations and the "many kinds of voices" carried within them.
Assessment is by quizzes, short writing assignments, a class presentation, and a final project.
<!--
