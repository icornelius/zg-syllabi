Loyola University provides equal opportunities in education without regard to, and does not discriminate on the basis of, age, color, disability, family responsibilities, familial status, gender identity or gender expression, marital status, national origin, personal appearance, political affiliation, race, religion, sex, sexual orientation, source of income, veteranâ€™s status, or any other factor prohibited by law.
Practicing respect for others is an important part of education.
Each member of our course has a responsibility to create an environment in which all may flourish.

An additional note on names and gender pronouns:
using appropriate names and gender pronouns honors and affirms individuals of all gender identities and gender expressions.
Misgendering and heteronormative language excludes the experiences of individuals whose identities may not fit the gender binary, and/or who may not identify with the sex they were assigned at birth.
During our first class, as we introduce ourselves, you may choose to share your name and gender pronouns.
If you do not wish to be called by the name listed on the roster, please inform us.
If you prefer to introduce yourself by name only, without pronouns, that is also fine.
The goal is to create an affirming environment for all students.
