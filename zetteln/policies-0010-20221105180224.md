Students in this course may earn extra credit by attending certain on-campus events and writing an event report on the Sakai blog.
Eligible events will be announced periodically during the semester.
Event reports should be about 150 words in length and are worth up to 5 points each.

At the end of the semester, all students will receive additional extra credit points if 80% or more of students complete the evaluation of this course.
Extra credit points in this case will be equivalent to 2% of total possible points in the course.
