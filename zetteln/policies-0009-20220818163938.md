Loyola University Chicago provides reasonable accommodations for students with disabilities.
Any student requesting accommodations related to a disability or other condition is required to register with the Student Accessibility Center (SAC).
Professors must be supplied with an accommodation notification from SAC, preferably within the first two weeks of class.
Students are encouraged to meet with their professors individually to discuss their accommodations.
All information will remain confidential.
For more information about registering with SAC or questions about accommodations, please contact SAC at 773-508-3700 or <SAC@luc.edu> or visit the [SAC website](http://www.luc.edu/sac/).

Please note that lectures in this class may be recorded to provide equal access to students with disabilities.
Such recordings may be made only as directed by SAC.
Students approved for this accommodation use recordings for their personal study only and recordings may not be shared with other people or used in any way against the faculty member, other lecturers, or students.
Recordings must be deleted at the end of the semester.
