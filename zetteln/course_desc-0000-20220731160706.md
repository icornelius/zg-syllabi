In this advanced seminar we examine some pre-industrial technologies of communication, entertainment, and learning, with a focus on English poetry written in the centuries before and after the introduction of print technology into Europe.
What was the printed book like in the early days, when presses were not yet powered by coal, and how were works of literature published, circulated, and read before print?
We study poetry by Geoffrey Chaucer, William Shakespeare, and their contemporaries and we inquire how these poems circulated in their own time and afterwards and why medium matters.
Students will learn to read one of the styles of handwriting used by medieval scribes and they will learn to read Middle English, the form of the English language used by Chaucer.
Themes include the production of manuscript books, the origins and development of print technology, diversity and standardization in the English language, the transmission of texts, variants and versions, and the emergence of an English monolingual literary culture (replacing the multilingual literary culture of medieval England).
Assessment is by midterm and final essays (the latter an independent research project), short written assignments, and class presentation.
