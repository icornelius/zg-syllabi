If illness or another event in your life prevents you from completing a written assignment on time, alert me promptly by email.
Do not wait for me to contact you.
I will usually accommodate late work, provided that you have a legitimate reason for requesting an extension.
Unexcused late work will be marked down 20% during the first 24 hours after the due date and a further 20% for each business day thereafter.
Work still outstanding one week (five business days) after the due date will receive a zero, unless the student has sought and received an extension, as described above.
Unexcused late work cannot be revised for a higher grade.
