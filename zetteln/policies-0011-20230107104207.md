If illness or another event in your life prevents you from completing a written assignment on time, alert me promptly by email.
Do not wait for me to contact you.
Unexcused late work will be marked down 10% during the first 24 hours after the due date and a further 10% for each business day thereafter.
Work still outstanding two weeks (ten business days) after the due date will receive a zero, unless the student has sought and received an extension, as described above.
<!--
Unexcused late work cannot be revised for a higher grade.
