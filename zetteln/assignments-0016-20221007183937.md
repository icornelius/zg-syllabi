Respond to one of the following prompts.
For general instructions, including page count and documentation, see the syllabus.

1. Explore some of the differences between a medieval manuscript and a modern edition.
Take the Wife of Bath's Prologue and Tale as a test case and support your argument with reference to scholarship on our syllabus.
Compare the presentation of this poem in our modern edition with the presentation of (the same?) poem in the Ellesmere manuscript of the *Canterbury Tales*.
Do the edition and the manuscript in fact present the same poem?
What are some of the differences between the presentations, and what are their implications?

1. Expand your response to a prompt from last week, on the sources for and annotations to The Wife of Bath's Prologue. 

1. Select one of the medieval manuscript books in University Archives and Special Collections.
To what extent does the book conform to the general features of manuscript books, as described by G. S. Ivy and the Harvard METRO site?

1. Write an essay on a topic of your own choice. Clear your topic with me in advance.
