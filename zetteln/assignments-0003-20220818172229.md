There are eight such assignments, of which you must complete six.
If you complete more than six, I will drop the lowest score(s).

Once during the semester, each student will circulate their response paper to the entire class as the basis for a [peer interview](#peer interview).
Students will sign up for this activity in the first week of class.
In the week that you circulate your response paper to class, this paper is due 24 hours in advance of our class meeting.
All other responses are due at the beginning of class, as stated [above](#formal-writing).
