To meet course objectives, you must attend class and be prepared to engage in discussion.
Arrange your schedule to be present for the entire session.
If you must miss a class for any reason, or if you must arrive late or leave early, inform me in advance by email.
Unexcused absences will be penalized at a rate of ten participation points per absence.

This course makes special provision for absences due to illness: see [Public Health](#public-health).
