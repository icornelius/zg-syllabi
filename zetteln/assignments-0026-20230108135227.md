Each student will give a 5-minute presentation on a literary term, supported by slides.
Literary terms should be selected from the *Oxford Dictionary of Literary Terms*, which is available as a digital resource via the Loyola Libraries website [@BaldickOxfordDictionaryLiterary2015].
Each presentation has two tasks:

1. Identify the literary term. Tell us how the term is defined in the *Oxford Dictionary of Literary Terms*.
If the definition given there is insufficient to provide a clear understanding, try searching for the term in the [Oxford Reference collection for literary studies](https://www-oxfordreference-com.flagship.luc.edu/page/literature).
1. Use the term. Apply the term in analysis of a song, movie, cartoon, video game, or another verbal artwork not on our syllabus.

Students will sign up for presentations in the second week of the semester.
Upload slides to the relevant section of the Sakai assignments page.
