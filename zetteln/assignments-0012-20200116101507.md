Each student will memorize a passage of the *Canterbury Tales*, as described in the course syllabus, and recite these lines in office hours or at another time to be arranged.
The objective in this exercise is to sharpen your understanding of Chaucer's language and art.

There are three components to a good recitation of poetry:

1.  **phonological**.
Vowels and consonants are pronounced in accordance with scholarly understanding of the poet's language.

3.  **formal**.
The reading expresses the rhythmic and metrical form of the poet's verse.

2.  **semantic**.
The reading expresses the meaning, style, and tone of the passage, typically through modulation of voice and pacing.

To prepare for this assignment, do the following:

- read the passage with care and attention
- follow the 'Reading Chaucer Tutorial' and
listen to readings of Chaucer's lines at <https://digital.wwnorton.com/canterbury>
- read the description of "Chaucer's Language of Meter" at pp. 35--45 in our edition of the *Canterbury Tales*
- complete the 'word study' exercise on the forum

Grade rubric:

- **A**: Successfully embodies all three components of a good recitation. Fluent delivery.
- **B**: Displays effort and thought about the three components.
- **C**: Incomplete memorization; rote or unreflective delivery.
