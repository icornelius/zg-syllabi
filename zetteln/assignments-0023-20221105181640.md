Respond to one of the following prompts.
For general instructions see the syllabus.

1. Respond to any prompt you did not select in last week's assignment. You may write on material from any part of the second quarto text of *Hamlet*.

1. Select two title pages from among those reproduced by Kastan in chapter 1 of *Shakespeare and the Book*.
Describe the title pages in as much detail as you can, drawing on Kastan's exposition and the relevant sections of Werner's *Studying Early Printed Books*.
What are the salient differences between the two title pages you have selected, and what significance do you attribute to them?
What are the salient differences from a modern title page, as represented by Werner's book or Thompson and Taylor's editions of *Hamlet*?

1. View a copy of the second quarto of *Hamlet* in the digital facsimile published by Internet Shakespeare Editions, available [here](https://internetshakespeare.uvic.ca/Library/facsimile/overview/book/Q2_Ham.html).
What, in your view, are the most important differences between the presentation of the text in the facsimile and in the modern edition you are using?
Make an argument for reading from the digital facsimile (or not).
What would be the best way to read this play today?
