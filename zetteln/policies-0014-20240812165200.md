As an instructor, I am a Responsible Campus Partner ("RCP") under Loyola's [Comprehensive Policy and Procedures for Addressing Discrimination, Sexual Misconduct, and Retaliation](https://www.luc.edu/comprehensivepolicy/) (available at [www.luc.edu/equity](http://www.luc.edu/equity)).
While my goal is for you to be able to engage fully and authentically with our course material through class discussions and written work, I also want to be transparent that as a RCP I am required to report certain disclosures of sexual misconduct (including sexual assault, sexual harassment, intimate partner and/or domestic violence, and/or stalking) to the [Office for Equity & Compliance](http://www.luc.edu/equity) ("OEC"). As the University's [Title IX](http://www.luc.edu/titleix) office, the OEC coordinates the University's response to reports and complaints of sexual misconduct (as well as discrimination of any kind) to ensure students' rights are protected.

As an instructor, I also have an obligation under Illinois law to report disclosures of or suspected instances of child abuse or neglect (<https://www.luc.edu/hr/legal-notices/mandatedreportingofchildabuseandneglect/>).

The University maintains such reporting requirements to ensure that any student who experiences sexual/gender-based violence receives accurate information about available resources and support.
Such reports **will not generate a report to law enforcement** (no student will ever be forced to file a report with the police).
Additionally, the University's resources and supports are available to all students even if a student chooses that they do not want any other action taken.
If you have any questions about this policy, you are encouraged to contact the OEC at <equity@luc.edu> or 773-508-7766. 

If you ever wish to speak with a **confidential** resource regarding gender-based violence, I encourage you to call [The Line](https://www.luc.edu/wellness/gender-basedviolence/advocacyline/) at 773-494-3810. The Line is staffed by confidential advocates from 8:30am-5pm M-F and 24 hours on the weekend when school is in session.
Advocates can provide support, talk through your options (medical, legal, LUC reporting, safety planning, etc.), and connect you with resources as needed -- *without* generating a report or record with the OEC. More information about The Line can be found at [luc.edu/wellness](https://www.luc.edu/wellness/).
