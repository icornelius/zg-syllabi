Students are expected to complete the reading assignments before each class meeting, as detailed on the course schedule.
Bring questions about the readings and be prepared to read and translate the Old English texts.
Any informal assignments, which may be announced from time to time, will count towards this grade component.
Unexcused absences will reduce your participation grade.
