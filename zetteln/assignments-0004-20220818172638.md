Prompts and instructions will be circulated two weeks in advance of the due date.

The final essay (10--12 pages) includes a research component.
Prompts and instructions will be circulated before the Thanksgiving break.
The [annotated bibliography](#annotated-bibliography) and the [research presentation](#research-presentation) are steps toward production of this essay.
