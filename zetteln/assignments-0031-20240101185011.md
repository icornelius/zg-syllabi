There are regular quizzes, usually on Thursdays, beginning in second week.
It is usually not possible to make up a missed quiz.
Exceptions are made for absences on account of a sponsored university event (for instance, mock trial) or illness: see [Attendance](#attendance) and [Public health](#public-health).
To qualify for a make-up quiz, notify me by email in advance of class.

Most quizzes will have five questions, worth one point each.
Questions may be multiple choice, true-or-false, or short answer.
Sometimes I will ask you to translate or comment on a short passage of Old English.
Content presented in peer presentations is eligible to appear on quizzes.
Your lowest two quiz scores will be dropped, i.e., not counted towards your course grade.
