Masks are not presently required in this classroom.
Students are invited to mask at any time and requested to do so if they have contact with someone who has [covid-19]{.smallcaps}, the flu, or another airborne illness.
Your professor will mask if, for instance, their domestic partner contracts a cold.
Do not be alarmed by this.

Please get tested regularly.
If you contract [covid-19]{.smallcaps} you should not attend class meetings during the "isolation period" [defined by](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/your-health/isolation.html) the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
The CDC has similar advice for the [flu](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/treatment/takingcare.htm#whatshould).
If you are isolating due to illness, notify me at the earliest opportunity; I will help you get caught up.
Absences due to illness are not charged against your participation score.

In response to changes in [covid-19]{.smallcaps} infection rates and following guidance of national, state, and city authorities, the university may re-institute a universal masking requirement.
We will comply with university regulations in this and all other matters of public health.
