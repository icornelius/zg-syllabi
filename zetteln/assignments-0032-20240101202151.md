One week after your presentation, submit a research report on your topic.
Your research report will have two parts, as follows:

First, a collection of ten notes, drawn from at least four different sources.
Each note should have the following components:

- A unique identifier for the note (for instance, an integer between 1 and 10)
- A unique title, to serve as a concise meaningful way of referencing the note
- A quotation. This is the nucleus of the note.
- The source citation, in MLA or Chicago format, as it would appear in a list of Works Cited.
  For guidance in the formatting of citations, see the instructions at the [Purdue Online Writing Lab](https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/research_and_citation/index.html) or another reputable source.
- The page number, if available, on which the quotation appears in the source
- A summary or paraphrase of the quotation. This may be shorter than the quoted passage.
- A commentary on the quotation (why is it noteworthy?). This should be longer than the quoted passage.
- Between three and five keywords

Second, a two-page summary and overview of your note collection, describing your research process and aims.
What questions motivated your research?
Which sources and search-procedures were most useful, and why?
What questions do you have at the end of this process?

Your sources must be printed books or digital on-line resources to which Loyola subscribes.
Non-scholarly sources located by web searches are not acceptable for this assignment.
To access e-books, databases, and other on-line library resources, use an on-campus internet connection or follow instructions for [off-campus access](https://libraries.luc.edu/offcampus).

A basic keyword search of Loyola's [library catalog](https://libraries.luc.edu/) will often produce useful leads.
Here are some specific hints:

- Each entry in [@LapidgeWileyBlackwellEncyclopediaAngloSaxon2014] \(on course reserves) has bibliographical recommendations.
- Oxford's [Bibliographies for Medieval Studies](https://www.oxfordbibliographies.com/browse?module_0=obo-9780195396584) has curated annotated bibliographies on many topics relevant to this class.
- I collect bibliographical recommendations on [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/groups/937002/intro_oe/library).
Navigate between sections in the left panel.
(This bibliography is based on the one printed by Peter Baker in his *Introduction to Old English*.)

[Library specialists](http://libraries.luc.edu/specialists) are helpful in the research stage of assignments involving secondary sources.
