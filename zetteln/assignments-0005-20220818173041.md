The annotated bibliography is a step toward the final essay.
Consult with me and with [library specialists](http://libraries.luc.edu/specialists) in selection of sources.
The Oxford Bibliographies are a good place to begin research:

- [Geoffrey Chaucer](https://www-oxfordbibliographies-com.flagship.luc.edu/view/document/obo-9780195396584/obo-9780195396584-0016.xml)
- [William Shakespeare](https://www-oxfordbibliographies-com.flagship.luc.edu/view/document/obo-9780195399301/obo-9780195399301-0052.xml)
- [Medieval Manuscripts](https://www-oxfordbibliographies-com.flagship.luc.edu/view/document/obo-9780199846719/obo-9780199846719-0165.xml)
- [Printing and the Book](https://www-oxfordbibliographies-com.flagship.luc.edu/view/document/obo-9780195399301/obo-9780195399301-0004.xml)

Select six sources for annotation and list another six sources that you considered but decided against.
Additional instructions will be supplied in due course.
