# Course description and learning outcomes

This foundational course in literary studies will require students to read closely and analyze carefully a representative variety of fiction, poetry, and drama, master key literary and critical terms, and explore a variety of core critical approaches to the analysis and interpretation of literature.
This course will also explore important conceptual questions about literature and its study.
What is literature?
Why does it matter?
How has it been conceived in different times and places?
How do we envision the relationship between author, text, and reader?
What is the difference between reading a literary work in its historical context and in the light of our own contemporary time?
Where does meaning come from in literature?
What is literary interpretation and what role does it have in the production of literary meaning?
How are literary works related to culture and society and how do they reflect -- and reflect on -- questions of value and the diversity of human experience?
Exploring these questions will help students develop the skills of analysis and interpretation needed to approach literature in a sophisticated manner.

This course satisfies the first tier of Loyola University's [Core Knowledge Area requirement in Literary Knowledge](https://catalog.luc.edu/undergraduate/university-requirements/university-core/core-area-and-courses/literary-knowledge-inquiry/).

After completing two courses in this Area, students will be able to:

1.  identify, explain, and analyze carefully key components of various literary productions that deepen understanding of human experiences and creative processes.
2.  use critical and technical vocabulary to describe, analyze, and formulate an argument about literary productions.
3.  assess how various forms of literary expression shape the experience and response of the audience.
4.  examine multiple interpretive possibilities of any literary work.
5.  articulate the relationships of works of literature to the cultures and histories in which they were created and used.

\end{itemize}
\end{multicols}

After you have selected a topic, begin planning your presentation.
Each presentation has three tasks:

1.  Tell us what the term means.
    If the *Oxford Dictionary of Literary Terms* provides a short entry for your term, quote the entry in full.
    If the entry is long, quote the most important parts.
    Discuss the definition and examples given by the *Oxford Dictionary of Literary Terms*. Clarify any difficult points.
2.  Use the term. Apply the term in analysis of a song, movie, cartoon, video game, or any verbal artwork not on our syllabus.
    Discuss the effect or significance of the literary device in the example you have selected.
3.  Seed a class discussion.
    For instance, you might ask us to respond to your example in (2), or invent another name for the literary device you have selected, or suggest another example of the literary device.

#### Slides {#slides .unnumbered}

Good presentations have a mix of concrete, relevant detail (including quotations) and explanatory commentary.
Put key points, factual detail, and quotations on slides; give commentary and explanation in your own voice.

Most students create slides with Google Slides, Canva, or Microsoft PowerPoint.
Aim for clarity and accessibility:

-   A clear font such as Times New Roman or Arial
-   Unpatterned backgrounds
-   Good contrast between lettering and background (black lettering on white background is perfectly fine)
-   A font size large enough to read from any seat in our classroom

Don't overwhelm us with lots of text in small type: if your topic for a given slide outgrows the dimensions of the slide, divide it among two or more slides.
Images are welcome, and necessary for some presentation topics.
But do not distract us with irrelevant graphics: keep the focus on your topic.

List your sources on the penultimate slide of your presentation.
These should include at least the *Oxford Dictionary of Literary Terms* and a citation for the artwork that you selected as illustration of your term.
Citations should be formatted in MLA or Chicago style.

On the last slide, list one or two questions for discussion.

Before your presentation, post a link to your slides in the "Wiki" section of Sakai, where you signed up for your presentation date.
Configure your document to be *viewable* (not editable) by anyone with the link.

#### Delivery {#delivery .unnumbered}

Aim to speak for about five minutes.

Speaking from notes or note-cards is perfectly fine.
Unless you are reading a quote, don't read directly from your slides.
But always read the quotations, or ask a volunteer to read them.

Every presentation is followed by a discussion period: here you facilitate a class discussion of the question(s) on your final slide.

### Rubric {#rubric-presentations}

Successful presentations have the following characteristics:

-   The literary term is *defined* clearly and accurately, using appropriate sources
-   The literary term is *illustrated* with a relevant example. The example is introduced and contextualized. The significance and effects of the literary device are explored in appropriate detail.
-   *Sources* are correctly cited
-   *Slides* are clear and accessible
-   *Delivery* is fluent, well organized, paced appropriately to the content and your audience, and fitted to time limits (neither too long nor too short)
-   *Discussion questions* invite thoughtful engagement from peers

Points are allocated as follows (10 points total):

  Component        Point value
  -------------- -------------
  definition                 2
  illustration               3
  slide design               2
  sources                    1
  delivery                   1
  Q&A                        1

A presentation that duplicates the topic of an earlier presentation in this course will receive additional point deductions.

# Policies

## Communication

Students are invited to speak with me during regular [office hours](#how-to-contact-me).
No appointment is required.
If a schedule conflict prevents you from visiting regular office hours, email me to request an alternative time.

Outside of office hours email is the best way to reach me.
I aim to respond to email messages within 24 hours on weekdays and within 48 hours on weekends.
I ask that you also respond promptly to any messages I may send.

## Policies on written work

### General policies

Students are invited to talk with me in office hours about any stage of the writing process and encouraged to discuss their writing with peer coaches at the [Writing Center](http://www.luc.edu/writing).

Writing should be submitted in two forms, paper and electronic.
Paper copies are due at the beginning of class.
An identical electronic copy should be uploaded to Sakai (the Assignments tab) in PDF format.
Observe the following details in regard to the layout of your text:

-   double-spaced text
-   a standard 12-point font
-   1-inch margins
-   numbered pages

Sources should be cited in [Chicago](https://www-chicagomanualofstyle-org.eu1.proxy.openathens.net/tools_citationguide/citation-guide-1.html)
or [MLA](https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/research_and_citation/mla_style/mla_style_introduction.html)
format.
Students are encouraged to use reference management software.
My preferred application is [zotero](https://www.zotero.org/).
It is free and open-source.

### How to cite the *Oxford English Dictionary*

The *Oxford English Dictionary* and *Middle English Dictionary* should be cited parenthetically, using a special format, for instance:

> (*OED Online*, "light, *adj.^2^ & n.^3^*")

This is a parenthetical citation for an [entry](https://www.oed.com/information/understanding-entries/oed-terminology/#entry) in the *Oxford English Dictionary*.
It would be placed within your text, immediately before the final mark of punctuation in the sentence in which you use the entry, for instance:

> The adjective *light* (antonym of *dark*) is first recorded in the Old English period (*OED Online*, "light, *adj.^2^ & n.^3^*").

In this sentence the final mark of punctuation is a period.
The parenthetical citation precedes that.
The parenthetical citation has two main parts:

1.  An abbreviated reference to the source-container for the cited entry: *OED Online*. This is italicized.
    The corresponding abbreviation for the online version of the *Middle English Dictionary* is *MED Online*.

2.  The title of the cited entry: "light, *adj.^2^ & n.^3^*". This is placed within quotes. It subdivides further, as follows:

    (a) a [headword](https://www.oed.com/information/understanding-entries/oed-terminology/#headword): "light"

    (b) abbreviation for the [part(s) of speech](https://www.oed.com/information/understanding-entries/glossary-grammatical-terms/#part-of-speech): "*adj.*" and "*n.*"

    (c) superscripted numerals. These are added to disambiguate entry titles in those cases where the dictionary records two or more words that share the same spelling and part of speech.
        (Compare the entries "light, *adj.^2^ & n.^3^*" and "light, *adj.^1^ & n.^2^*")

If you cite a specific sense or [meaning](https://www.oed.com/information/understanding-entries/oed-terminology/#meaning) within an entry, extend the parenthetical citation as shown in the following example:

> In the Middle English period the adjective *light* developed the sense 'pale' (*OED Online*, "light, *adj.^2^ & n.^3^*," meaning 3.a).

The first two parts of this parenthetical citation are identical with the earlier one, above.
The third part, "meaning 3.a", references a specific meaning within the entry.

## Academic integrity

Loyola University Chicago takes seriously the issues of plagiarism and academic integrity.
This course abides by the relevant policies of the university's [Undergraduate Studies Catalog](https://catalog.luc.edu/academic-standards-regulations/undergraduate/) (see under "Academic Integrity").

If you are uncertain what constitutes plagiarism, consult the Undergraduate Studies Catalog.
If you are still uncertain, ask me.

Except where explicitly permitted in assignment instructions, use of generative artificial intelligence in assignments or exams is prohibited.

## Attendance

<!--
To meet course objectives, you must attend class and be prepared to engage in discussion.
Arrange your schedule to be present for the entire class session.
-->

If you must miss a class, or if you must arrive late or leave early, inform me in advance by email.
This course makes special provision for absences due to religious observances (see [Religious Observances](#religious-observances)) or illness (see [Public Health](#public-health)).

On a limited and pre-approved basis, a student may miss a class to participate in a University-sponsored event (e.g., official athletic games). It is the student's obligation to inform their instructor of such an authorized absence in a timely fashion; in most cases, this information can be made available to the instructor at the beginning of the semester.

## Equity and compliance

### Nondiscrimination statement

Loyola University provides equal opportunities in education without regard to, and does not discriminate on the basis of, age, color, disability, family responsibilities, familial status, gender identity or gender expression, marital status, national origin, personal appearance, political affiliation, race, religion, sex, sexual orientation, source of income, veteran's status, or any other factor prohibited by law.
Practicing respect for others is an important part of education.
Each member of our course has a responsibility to create an environment in which all may flourish.

### Religious observances

This course strives to accommodate major religious holidays that might affect students' attendance in class.
Campus Ministries maintains a list of recognized [religious observances](https://www.luc.edu/campusministry/faithprograms/interfaith/religiousobservances/).
To receive accommodations, please be in touch with me in advance.

### Reporting obligations for Responsible Campus Partners

As an instructor, I am a Responsible Campus Partner ("RCP") under Loyola's [Comprehensive Policy and Procedures for Addressing Discrimination, Sexual Misconduct, and Retaliation](https://www.luc.edu/comprehensivepolicy/) (available at [www.luc.edu/equity](http://www.luc.edu/equity)).
While my goal is for you to be able to engage fully and authentically with our course material through class discussions and written work, I also want to be transparent that as a RCP I am required to report certain disclosures of sexual misconduct (including sexual assault, sexual harassment, intimate partner and/or domestic violence, and/or stalking) to the [Office for Equity & Compliance](http://www.luc.edu/equity) ("OEC"). As the University's [Title IX](http://www.luc.edu/titleix) office, the OEC coordinates the University's response to reports and complaints of sexual misconduct (as well as discrimination of any kind) to ensure students' rights are protected.

As an instructor, I also have an obligation under Illinois law to report disclosures of or suspected instances of child abuse or neglect (<https://www.luc.edu/hr/legal-notices/mandatedreportingofchildabuseandneglect/>).

The University maintains such reporting requirements to ensure that any student who experiences sexual/gender-based violence receives accurate information about available resources and support.
Such reports **will not generate a report to law enforcement** (no student will ever be forced to file a report with the police).
Additionally, the University's resources and supports are available to all students even if a student chooses that they do not want any other action taken.
If you have any questions about this policy, you are encouraged to contact the OEC at <equity@luc.edu> or 773-508-7766. 

If you ever wish to speak with a **confidential** resource regarding gender-based violence, I encourage you to call [The Line](https://www.luc.edu/wellness/gender-basedviolence/advocacyline/) at 773-494-3810. The Line is staffed by confidential advocates from 8:30am-5pm M-F and 24 hours on the weekend when school is in session.
Advocates can provide support, talk through your options (medical, legal, LUC reporting, safety planning, etc.), and connect you with resources as needed -- *without* generating a report or record with the OEC. More information about The Line can be found at [luc.edu/wellness](https://www.luc.edu/wellness/).

### Names and pronouns

Using appropriate names and gender pronouns honors and affirms individuals of all gender identities and gender expressions.
Misgendering and heteronormative language excludes the experiences of individuals whose identities may not fit the gender binary, and/or who may not identify with the sex they were assigned at birth.

If you wish, please share your gender pronouns with me and the class when you introduce yourself, on your name placard, and/or on your Zoom profile.
If you prefer to introduce yourself by name only, without pronouns, that is also fine.
If you do not wish to be called by the name that appears on the class roster or attendance sheet, please let me know privately and I will work to honor your wishes.
The goal is to create an affirming environment for all students.

By giving my pronouns as "he \| any", I mean to leave you free to use the pronouns that come naturally to you in reference to me.
The pipe character means "or".

### Accommodations and assistance

Loyola University Chicago provides reasonable accommodations for students with disabilities.
Any student requesting accommodations related to a disability or other condition is required to register with the Student Accessibility Center (SAC).
Professors must be supplied with an accommodation notification from SAC, preferably within the first two weeks of class.
Students are encouraged to meet with their professors individually to discuss their accommodations.
All information will remain confidential.
For more information about registering with SAC or questions about accommodations, please contact SAC at 773-508-3700 or <SAC@luc.edu> or visit the [SAC website](http://www.luc.edu/sac/).

Please note that SAC sometimes grants individual students permission to record class sessions.
Such recordings may be made only as directed by SAC.
Students approved for this accommodation use recordings for their personal study only and recordings may not be shared with other people or used in any way against the faculty member, other lecturers, or students.
Recordings must be deleted at the end of the semester.

## Public health

Masks are not presently required in this classroom.
Students are invited to mask at any time and requested to do so if they have contact with someone who has [covid-19]{.smallcaps}, the flu, or another airborne illness.
Your professor will mask if, for instance, their domestic partner contracts a cold.
Do not be alarmed by this.

Please get tested regularly.
If you contract [covid-19]{.smallcaps} you should not attend class meetings during the [isolation period](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/your-health/isolation.html) defined by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
The CDC has similar advice for the [flu](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/treatment/takingcare.htm#whatshould).
If you are isolating due to illness, notify me at the earliest opportunity; I will help you get caught up.
Absences due to illness are not charged against your participation score.

In response to changes in [covid-19]{.smallcaps} infection rates and following guidance of national, state, and city authorities, the university may re-institute a universal masking requirement.
We will comply with university regulations in this and all other matters of public health.
