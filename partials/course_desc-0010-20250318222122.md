Write it like you mean it

Modern computers provide two basic paradigms for document authoring: What You See is What You Get (WYSIWYG) and What You See Is What You Mean ([WYSIWYM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WYSIWYM)).
Most people use the WISIWIG paradigm without knowing it; this course introduces students to the other paradigm, centered on meaning.
Our focus is on the unique properties of text, a lightweight and versatile medium for encoding and transmitting knowledge.
Plain text has inherent advantages in comparison with proprietary file formats like Microsoft Word's DOCX (which lock users in to inefficient, cluttered, and expensive software environments) and in comparison with audio-visual media (which must be tagged with textual metadata to facilitate discovery, interpretation, and accessibility).
But the very ubiquity of text leads us to overlook its unique virtues and neglect the tools needed to properly activate them.
In this course students acquire a working knowledge of the [Zotero reference management system](https://www.zotero.org/),
standard text editors,
and a full stack of terminal-controlled applications ---
[git](https://git-scm.com/),
[pandoc](https://pandoc.org/),
[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)
and more ---
to create, organize, edit, document, and distribute knowledge.
Assessment is by scaffolded writing assignments, quizzes, and in-class presentations.
