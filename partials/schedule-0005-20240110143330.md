The course schedule complies with the [Loyola University academic calendar](https://www.luc.edu/academics/schedules).

Readings should be completed as preparation for class on the date listed.
The [Bibliography](#bibliography) supplies full bibliographic details for course readings.

If there is need to revise the course schedule, I will announce the change in class and on Sakai and publish an updated version of this syllabus.
See [Version Information](#version-information).
