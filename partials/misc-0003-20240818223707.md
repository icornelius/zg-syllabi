The *Oxford English Dictionary* and *Middle English Dictionary* should be cited parenthetically, using a special format, for instance:

> (*OED Online*, "light, *adj.^2^ & n.^3^*")

This is a parenthetical citation for an [entry](https://www.oed.com/information/understanding-entries/oed-terminology/#entry) in the *Oxford English Dictionary*.
It would be placed within your text, immediately after the final mark of punctuation in the sentence in which you use the entry, for instance:

> The adjective *light* (antonym of *dark*) is first recorded in the Old English period (*OED Online*, "light, *adj.^2^ & n.^3^*").

In this sentence the final mark of punctuation is a period.
The parenthetical citation immediately precedes that.
The parenthetical citation has two main parts:

1. An abbreviated reference to the source-container for the cited entry: *OED Online*. This is italicized.
   The corresponding abbreviation for the online version of the *Middle English Dictionary* is *MED Online*.

2. The title of the cited entry: "light, *adj.^2^ & n.^3^*". This is placed within quotes. It subdivides further, as follows:

   (a) a [headword](https://www.oed.com/information/understanding-entries/oed-terminology/#headword): "light"

   (a) abbreviation for the [part(s) of speech](https://www.oed.com/information/understanding-entries/glossary-grammatical-terms/#part-of-speech): "*adj.*" and "*n.*"

   (a) superscripted numerals. These are added to disambiguate entry titles in those cases where the dictionary records two or more words that share the same spelling and part of speech.
   (Compare the entries "light, *adj.^2^ & n.^3^*" and "light, *adj.^1^ & n.^2^*")

If you cite a specific sense or [meaning](https://www.oed.com/information/understanding-entries/oed-terminology/#meaning) within an entry, extend the parenthetical citation as shown in the following example:

> In the Middle English period the adjective *light* developed the sense 'pale' (*OED Online*, "light, *adj.^2^ & n.^3^*," meaning 3.a).

The first two parts of this parenthetical citation are identical with the one above.
The third part, "meaning 3.a" references a specific meaning within the entry.
