Students are expected to complete the reading assignments before each class meeting, as detailed on the course schedule, and be prepared to talk about them.
Bring questions and observations.
Any informal assignments, which may be announced from time to time, will count towards this grade component.
Persistent unexcused absences will reduce your participation grade.
See [attendance](#attendance).
