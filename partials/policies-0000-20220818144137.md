This course makes special provision for absences due to religious observances (see [Religious Observances](#religious-observances)) or illness (see [Public Health](#public-health)).

On a limited and pre-approved basis, a student may miss a class to participate in a University-sponsored event (e.g., official athletic games). It is the student's obligation to inform their instructor of such an authorized absence in a timely fashion; in most cases, this information can be made available to the instructor at the beginning of the semester.
