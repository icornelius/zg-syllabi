In this course we learn to read Middle English, the form of the English language in use between about eight hundred and about five hundred years ago.
Looking back at an even earlier age, one poet from this period wrote, "wordes tho / That hadden pris, now wonder nyce and straunge / Us thinketh hem, and yet thei spake hem so" (words that were then current now appear to us as very senseless and foreign, and yet they spoke them just so).
We orient ourselves within this language, then read several of the great narrative poems written in Middle English: dream poems of Geoffrey Chaucer (often described as the greatest English poet prior to Shakespeare), William Langland's *Piers Plowman* (a surreal vision quest), and the anonymous Arthurian romance *Sir Gawain and the Green Knight* (easily the cleverest entry in its genre).
The last of these we read in a dual-language edition (Middle English with facing-page translation into Present-Day English).
This prompts us to consider the aims and techniques of literary translation.
