The midterm essay and translation and critical commentary may be revised for a higher grade.
Revisions are due one week after return of marked essays.
Revised essays should be accompanied by your original submission with my handwritten comments and by a cover letter that summarizes your revisions.
The cover letter should be at least 200 words in length.

[Response papers](#response-papers) are not eligible for revision, but you can replace a low grade on a response paper by writing more than the minimum number.
