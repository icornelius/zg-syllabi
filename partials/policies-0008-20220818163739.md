Using appropriate names and gender pronouns honors and affirms individuals of all gender identities and gender expressions.
Misgendering and heteronormative language excludes the experiences of individuals whose identities may not fit the gender binary, and/or who may not identify with the sex they were assigned at birth.

If you wish, please share your gender pronouns with me and the class when you introduce yourself, on your name placard, and/or on your Zoom profile.
If you prefer to introduce yourself by name only, without pronouns, that is also fine.
If you do not wish to be called by the name that appears on the class roster or attendance sheet, please let me know privately and I will work to honor your wishes.
The goal is to create an affirming environment for all students.

By giving my pronouns as "he | any", I mean to leave you free to use the pronouns that come naturally to you in reference to me.
The pipe character means "or".
