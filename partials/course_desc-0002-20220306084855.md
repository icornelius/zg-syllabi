The English language originated in migration and settlement.
The area of settlement was subsequently named "England," a region with a complex linguistic ecology where English developed into a kaleidoscope of local dialects.
In the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries the language began to spread beyond the British isles; during the same period the language contracted into a standard written form.
Today, after a long period of standardization, English is diversifying again, on account of its worldwide use by some 2 billion people, most of whom are multilingual.

In this seminar we study the development of the English language from Indo-European to the internet.
Topics include speech sounds and writing systems;
words as units of meaning and structure;
concepts of variation, standardization, dialect, and register;
diachrony and synchrony;
language contact and multilingualism;
socio-linguistic status and domains of use;
technologies of communication (writing, print, audio broadcast, 'social media,' etc.);
and tools for language study (the International Phonetic Alphabet, the Oxford English Dictionary, linguistic corpora).
Assessment is by written assignments, a class presentation, and midterm and final exams.

Outcomes:

- Students will demonstrate knowledge of the history of English and some understanding of linguistic theory
