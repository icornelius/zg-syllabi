The word *poetry* derives from an ancient Greek word meaning 'to make'.
English and Scottish poets were once called *makers*.
What do poets make and what is their material?
In this course we approach poetry as artwork made from language.
We read a selection of narrative and lyric poetry in English and we explore the ways poets create their art through selection, arrangement, and presentation of linguistic materials.
Topics include English speech sounds, rhythm, meter, words, sentences, punctuation, visual presentation, and performance.
Assessment is by quizzes, midterm and final exams, and a class presentation.
