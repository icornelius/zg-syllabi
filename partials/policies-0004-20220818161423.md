If you are uncertain what constitutes plagiarism, consult the Undergraduate Studies Catalog at the link above.
If you are still uncertain, ask me.

Use of generative artificial intelligence in assignments or exams is prohibited.
Any exception to this policy will be stated in assignment instructions and will apply only to that assignment.
