Loyola University Chicago takes seriously the issues of plagiarism and academic integrity.
This course abides by the relevant policies of the university's [Undergraduate Studies Catalog](http://www.luc.edu/academics/catalog/undergrad/reg_academicintegrity.shtml).

Plagiarism will result in a grade of zero for the plagiarized exam or assignment and the incident will be reported to your dean.
If you are uncertain what constitutes plagiarism, consult the Writing Center's guide on [Defining and Avoiding Plagiarism](http://wpacouncil.org/aws/CWPA/pt/sd/news_article/272555/_PARENT/layout_details/false).
If you are still uncertain, please ask me.

Plagiarism includes submitting, as you own work, text derived from a generative artificial intelligence application.
