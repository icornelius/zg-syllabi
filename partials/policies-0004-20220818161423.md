Loyola University Chicago takes seriously the issues of plagiarism and academic integrity.
This course abides by the relevant policies of the university's [Undergraduate Studies Catalog](https://catalog.luc.edu/academic-standards-regulations/undergraduate/) (see under "Academic Integrity").

If you are uncertain what constitutes plagiarism, consult the Undergraduate Studies Catalog.
If you are still uncertain, ask me.

Except where explicitly permitted in assignment instructions, use of generative artificial intelligence in assignments or exams is prohibited.
