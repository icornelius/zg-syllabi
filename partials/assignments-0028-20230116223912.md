After spring break students will make presentations on class readings.
For this assignment students will work in pairs; each pair will be responsible for discussing their approach to note-taking on one course reading.
The presentation should be about ten minutes in length and supported by slides.
Usually a presentation will be followed by class discussion;
the best presentations invite thoughtful response from your peers.
Further instructions will be given in the week before spring break.
