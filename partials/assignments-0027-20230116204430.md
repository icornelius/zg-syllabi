This course has the following formal writing assignments:

- Two research reports (3 pages each) on topics covered in weeks 2--6
- One mid-term essay (6 pages)
- Two collections of notes on topics covered in weeks 8--13, accompanied by rationale and reflection
- One final essay (6 pages)

Due dates are listed on the course [schedule](#schedule).
Instructions will be distributed one week in advance of due dates.
The formal assignments are preceded by ungraded assignments, including blog-posting.
Instructions for these informal assignments will be given in class sessions.
Students are invited to talk with me in office hours about any stage of the writing process and encouraged to discuss their writing with peer tutors at the [writing center](http://www.luc.edu/writing).

Research reports and essays should be submitted in two forms, paper and electronic.
Paper copies are due at the beginning of class.
An identical electronic copy should be uploaded to Sakai (the Assignments tab) in docx, odt, or pdf format.

We give particular attention to note-taking and citation.
In the first half, we discuss tools and techniques for note-taking.
In the second half, students will present collections of notes to the class and reflect on their note-taking strategies.
In preparation for these activities, review [note-taking apps](https://alternativeto.net/category/productivity/note-taking/)
and reflect on the [Zettelkasten method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zettelkasten).

Sources should be cited in a Chicago style, either note or author-date.
For guidance see the [Chicago Manual of Style](https://www-chicagomanualofstyle-org.flagship.luc.edu/tools_citationguide.html), but use reference management software to help you write citations.
My preferred application is [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/).
It is free and open-source.
There are [alternatives](https://alternativeto.net/software/zotero/about/).

Bibliographical references for course readings can be downloaded from my [Zotero library](https://www.zotero.org/irc7/collections/IFUSR7AL) in machine-readable formats.
Select all items in the folder "ENGL 300," then select "Export" (the left-most option at the top of the central pane).
Alternatively, copy the relevant bibliography file from [GitHub](https://github.com/icornelius/zg-syllabi/tree/main/bibliographies).
Bibliographical details in the course collection have been checked for accuracy, but errors are always possible.
If you find errors, I will be glad to know of them.
