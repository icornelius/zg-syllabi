# Detailed instructions {#detailed-instructions-dict-entry}

## Write a dictionary entry {.unnumbered}

Write a dictionary entry in the style of the *Oxford English Dictionary* (*OED*) for a word used in Present-Day English and as yet unrecorded in the *OED*.
You may select any Present-Day English word not already recorded in the *OED*.
Identify your word by reflecting on the varieties of English which you use and/or encounter in present-day written sources.
Draw up a list of words that seem to you innovative, then check to see whether the *OED* records them.
You may find it useful to browse recent issues of the scholarly journal [*American Speech*](https://read.dukeupress.edu/american-speech/issue) \(see the regular feature "Among the New Words"),
or [urbandictionary.com](https://www.urbandictionary.com/),
or prompt a large language model (LLM).
(For advice on LLMs see instructions for the [First Report](#prompt-an-llm).


Select a *word*, not an idiom or meaning.
Once you have identified a word unrecorded by the *OED*, begin collecting illustrations of usage.
Your dictionary entry should be supported by five or more illustrative quotations drawn from a variety of public and verifiable sources.
If you found your word in "Among the New Words" or urbandictionary.com, use that source as one of your five illustrative quotations.
For other illustrative quotations, search library databases (for instance, [Access World News](https://libguides.luc.edu/access-world-news), used in the First Report) and the open web.
Web forums and social media may supply especially rich mines of usage.
Cite all sources in [MLA style](https://style.mla.org/works-cited/citations-by-format/).
If you cannot find at least five instances of your word, distributed across a range of dates and sources, choose a better attested word.

Once you have gathered illustrative quotations, craft a dictionary entry for your word in the style of the *OED*.
Your dictionary entry should include the following parts:

1. Entry title. The [headword](https://www.oed.com/information/understanding-entries/oed-terminology/?tl=true#headword) and part of speech.
1. Etymology. Is your word borrowed from a language other than English or formed within English by derivation?
   Identify the source(s).
   If your word was formed within English, identify the mechanism of word-formation.
   Use appropriate terms and concepts from @AlgeoOriginsDevelopmentEnglish2013, chap. 11.
1. Meaning and use. Write one or more definitions for your word and supply illustrative quotations for each definition.
   Supply usage notes if appropriate: is your word restricted to a particular variety of English or domain of use?
   Organize definitions and illustrative quotations chronologically.
1. Pronunciation. Supply a typical pronunciation for your word. This should be written in the *OED*'s variant of the International Phonetic Alphabet.
1. Forms. Record variant spellings of your word, if any.
   If your word is a noun or verb with irregular inflectional morphology, record the plural of the noun and the past tense and past participle of the verb.

## Dialogue with an LLM {.unnumbered}

Test an LLM's awareness of your word.
If you consulted an LLM in the previous part, use a different LLM for this part.
First try to get the LLM to use the word without using it yourself.
Be creative.
Then ask the LLM to define the word and generate examples of usage.
Summarize your interaction with the LLM in a brief report (about 200 words).
Cite the LLM as instructed in MLA's guide ["How do I cite generative AI in MLA style?"](https://style.mla.org/citing-generative-ai/).

## Overview and reflection {.unnumbered}

Write an overview and reflection on your research process and its results.
What methods did you use to select your word?
Which sources and search-procedures were most useful and why?
What difficulties did you encounter in construction of the dictionary entry?
In the course of this research, what additional observations did you make, which could not readily be accommodated within the format of the dictionary entry?
Compare the LLM-generated definition(s) and examples with the examples you collected and the definition you wrote.
What questions do you have at the end of this process?
This overview should be about 500 words.

## Works Cited {.unnumbered}

Supply accurate, MLA-style citations for all sources.
