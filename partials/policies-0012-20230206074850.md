Graded papers and essays may be revised for a higher grade, with exceptions described below.
Revisions are due one week after return of marked essays.
Revised essays should be accompanied by your original submission (with my handwritten comments) and by a cover letter that summarizes your revisions.
The cover letter should be at least 200 words in length.

The final project is not eligible for revision; nor are essays submitted late without excuse.
