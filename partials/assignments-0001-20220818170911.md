Students in this writing-intensive seminar will produce formal writing on a weekly basis and discuss their work with peers at selected points during the semester.

Students are invited to talk with me in office hours about any stage of the writing process and encouraged to discuss their writing with peer tutors at the [writing center](http://www.luc.edu/writing).

Writing should be submitted in two forms, paper and electronic.
Paper copies are due at the beginning of class.
An identical electronic copy should be uploaded to Sakai (the Assignments tab) in PDF format.
Observe the following details in regard to the *mise-en-page* of your text:

- double-spaced text
- a standard 12-point font
- 1-inch margins
- numbered pages

Sources should be cited in [Chicago](https://www-chicagomanualofstyle-org.flagship.luc.edu/tools_citationguide/citation-guide-1.html)
or [MLA](https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/research_and_citation/mla_style/mla_style_introduction.html)
format.
Students are encouraged to use reference management software.
My preferred application is [zotero](https://www.zotero.org/).
It is free and open-source.
