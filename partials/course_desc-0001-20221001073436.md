What power does a voice have?
In this course we study defiant, bold, despondent, and expressive voices that speak out from the pages of literary poetry, drama, and prose.
Readings include
Gloria Anzald√∫a's "How to Tame a Wild Tongue,"
The Wife of Bath's Prologue (from Geoffrey Chaucer's *Canterbury Tales*),
Margery Kempe's *Book*,
Herman Melville's "Bartleby the Scrivener",
John Milton's *Paradise Lost* (book 1),
Plato's *Apology of Socrates*,
Shakespeare's *The Tempest*,
Sophocles's *Antigone*,
and short poems by
Gwendolyn Brooks,
Emily Dickinson,
Paul Laurence Dunbar,
Langston Hughes,
Edna St. Vincent Millay,
and
Dudley Randall,
among others.
Topics include sound pattern, verse form, genre, convention, discursive address, footing, figurative language, character, dialogue, plot, and narration.
We gain experience of forms of English different from the modern standard and we develop heightened and sharpened powers of attention to literary creations and the "many kinds of voices" carried within them.
Assessment is by quizzes, a class presentation, and midterm and final exams.
