This course provides a survey of medieval literature of the British isles.
We read a few of the best and most influential works of literature composed during the first nine hundred years of English literary history;
we also sample the medieval British literature written in languages other than English.
Likely readings include *Beowulf* and other Old English poems, "The Scholar and his Cat" and other Old Irish poems, the *Mabinogi*, poems of Marie de France, poems of Meir of Norwich, *Piers Plowman*, *Sir Gawain and the Green Knight*, poems of Geoffrey Chaucer, and *The Book of Margery Kempe* (the first autobiography in English).
Works written originally in Latin, Old English, Old French, Old Irish, Middle Welsh, and Hebrew will be read in Present-Day English translations.
Some Middle English will be read in the original language.
Long works are excerpted to provide a tasting menu of the diverse literatures that survive from the multilingual cultures of premodern Britain.
Assessment is by written assignments, a class presentation, and midterm and final exams.
